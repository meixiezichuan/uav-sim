    Neighbor table of motion controller

    Neighbors in this algorithm is mainly used to calculate repulsive force

    Attributes:
        env: simpy environment
        my_drone: the drone that installed the GPSR
        neighbor_table: a dictionary, used to store the neighbor's information
        entry_life_time: lifetime of each item in the neighbor table
        k: The elastic coefficient of a spring
        desired_distance: when the distance between two nodes is below 'desired_distance', a repulsive force
                          will be generated
