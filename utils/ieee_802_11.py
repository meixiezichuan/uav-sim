        Several notes about IEEE 802.11b:
        - Spectrum partitioning (one can see img folder):
          - The IEEE 802.11b/g standard operates in the 2.4G band, with a frequency range of 2.400-2.4835 GHz and a 
            total bandwidth of 83.5 MHz
          - There are total 14 channels
          - The bandwidth of each sub-channel is 22 MHz
          - The available channels mentioned above are defined with 5 MHz separation between consecutive carries
          - There is frequency band overlap between multiple adjacent sub-channels 
          - DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum) is most commonly used in IEEE 802.11, once spread, the resulting
            signal occupies a bandwidth of about 20 MHz, which is sightly lower than the bandwidth of a sub-channel
          - In 2.4 GHz band, only three sub-channels (1, 6 and 11) are non-overlapping.
        
        - Different bit rate:
          - 1 Mbps
          - 2 Mbps
          - 5.5 Mbps
          - 11 Mbps
