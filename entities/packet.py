class Packet:
    """
    Basic properties of the packet

    all other packets need to inherit this class

    Attributes:
        packet_id: identifier of the packet, used to uniquely represent a packet
        creation_time: the generation time of the packet
        deadline: maximum segment lifetime of packet, in second
        __ttl: current "Time to live (TTL)"
        number_retransmission_attempt: record the number of retransmissions of packet on different drones
        waiting_start_time: the time at which tha packet is added to the "transmitting queue" of drone
        first_attempt_time: the time at which the packet starts the backoff stage
        transmitting_start_time: the time at which the packet can be transmitted to the channel after backoff
        time_delivery: the time at which the packet arrives at its destination
        time_transmitted_at_last_hop: the transmitting time at last drone
        transmission_mode: unicast or multicast or broadcast?
